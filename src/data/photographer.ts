  biography: `Hey! I'm Shaan Taji, a 10th-grade student from Kerala, India with a deep passion for technology and coding. I love building websites, creating Python apps, and exploring the world of AI-powered development.

I'm fascinated by the idea of "vibe coding" with AI—using artificial intelligence as a creative partner to build amazing things faster and smarter. Looking ahead, I dream of working with robotics, VR technology, and other cutting-edge innovations that will shape our future.

I've already started my journey by creating two websites: "Pause and Say" and "Grid-Serpent". These projects have taught me so much about web development and ignited my passion to keep learning and building.`,
